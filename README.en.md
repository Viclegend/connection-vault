# 🛡️ Connection Vault

[繁體中文](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [English](README.en.md)

A lightweight, containerized Web application designed for SI (System Integration) teams, IT operators, and Home Lab enthusiasts managing multiple Hyper-V or Kubernetes (K8s) nodes. Say goodbye to scattered spreadsheets and manage all your server, VM, and network device connection credentials in one secure, centralized vault.

## 🌟 Key Features

* 🔄 **Batch Import & Export:** One-click CSV import. Automatically creates new groups or updates existing device credentials.
* 🔍 **Smart Global Search:** Real-time filtering by group, device name, IP, or username.
* 🔒 **Security First:** Admin authentication, default password masking, and accidental deletion prevention.
* 🌗 **Modern UI:** Clean accordion-style interface with Dark/Light mode toggle.

## 🐳 Quick Start

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your host.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Viclegend/connection-vault.git
cd connection-vault
```

**2. Configure Environment**
Copy the template and set your preferred port and admin credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**3. Deploy**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```
🎉 **Access:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://<Host-IP>:<Port>`. All data is securely persisted in the `./data` directory.

## 🔄 CSV Import Rules

When using the built-in Import feature, please adhere to the following:
1. **Format:** Only `.csv` files with **UTF-8 BOM** encoding are supported (we highly recommend downloading the Template directly from the Web UI).
2. **Update Mechanism:** If an imported row matches an existing "Group + Device Name", the system will automatically overwrite and update the credentials with the new data.
